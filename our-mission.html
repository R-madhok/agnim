    <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left; line-height: 1.8;">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">At Agnim Group, we believe that the most transformative ideas often come from the youngest and most passionate minds. Students today are not just learners; they are creators, builders, and visionaries. However, the path from a brilliant idea to a sustainable venture is filled with challenges, from securing initial funding to navigating market complexities and building a strong team.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Traditional consulting and investment models are often inaccessible to student-led initiatives, which may lack the formal structure or initial capital that these models require. This creates a critical gap, leaving a wealth of potential untapped.</p>
      <p>Our mission is to bridge this gap. We were founded on a simple, powerful principle: to ignite the potential of student-led nonprofits and startups by providing them with the strategic guidance, resources, and hands-on support they need to thrive. We operate on a unique model that aligns our success with theirs, taking a board seat or a small equity stake instead of charging fees. This ensures we are true partners in their journey, fully invested in their long-term impact.</p>
